I built this with HTML5 and CSS. I used flexbox on a mobile first design. It turned out that with this design specifically there was no need for a media query. I also used SCSS to compile all of the css. As you can tell I've never had to do a ReadMe file before so I apologize for the format. I had issues getting the background image to make the position it was on for the desktop design. I'm also new to using Github but I wanted to post the code and see what could have been done better. I know that there were quite a few things I could have made more clean and I would like some feedback. Thank you.
